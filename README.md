Hi there, my name is Alejandro and I'm a Senior Backend Engineer. I've collaborated with a few Open Source projects and initiatives, like [Nodeschool](https://nodeschool.io/) and 
[Nodeconf Argentina](https://nodeconfar.com). In my free time I love to brew coffee, play videogames and listen to live music.
